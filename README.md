I'm yash trivedi, I started coding when i was 11. 
Ofcourse back then it was just Qbasic and simple stuff. 
However my real interest picked up in 11th grade with an introduction to C++ while i was 15. 
With C++ i discovered my love for programmming and creating funky, functional, programs, physics inspired games.
Basically testing anything and everything taught in physics and fixing all the equations up in the program to test out it's real capabilities.
